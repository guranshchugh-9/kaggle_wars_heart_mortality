**Heart Disease and Stroke Mortality Analysis (2000–2019)**

## **Introduction**

This repository provides an analysis of heart disease and stroke mortality trends across the United States over a 20-year period (2000–2019). The dataset is county-level and segmented by age group, race/ethnicity, and sex, enabling a comprehensive examination of health disparities and trends. It focuses on key cardiovascular conditions, including coronary heart disease, stroke, and hypertension, to reveal regional and demographic patterns in mortality rates.

## **Dataset Overview**

The dataset offers:

- **20 Years of Data**: Longitudinal data covering two decades of cardiovascular health.
- **County-Level Granularity**: Regional insights to identify high-risk areas.
- **Demographic Breakdown**: Segmentation by age, race/ethnicity, and sex.

## **Key Features**

- **Trends in mortality rates for heart disease and stroke.**
- **Insights into demographic and regional health disparities.**
- **Data-driven support for public health interventions.**

## **Goals of the Project**

- **Examine trends in heart disease and stroke mortality over time.**
- **Identify regions and populations at higher risk.**
- **Highlight health disparities across demographic groups.**
- **Provide insights to inform public health policies and planning.**
